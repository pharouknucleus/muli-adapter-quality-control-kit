# muli-adapter-quality-control-kit
## Background and Problem
 It was reported that â€œthere are over 4000 x-ray machines in Nigeria with less than 5% of them under any form of regulatory control of the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA).There is, therefore, a need for proper Quality Assurance QA testing during installation and control tests at regular intervals as this will further help to reduce repeated radiograph and rejected films thereby saving cost and reducing patient doses. This project is aimed at deterring the level of compliance of QA across radiology centres in Kano State and to also move ahead to develop a robust, multi-adaptor quality control kit for all forms of x-ray equipment. This will help to develop local capacity, improve healthcare and promote wellbeing for all ages of Nigerians in-line with Sustainable Development Goal 3.
## Problems
1.Lack of data X-ray centers 
2.Failure to follow regulatory policy
3.Absence of quality control and quality assurance equipment
