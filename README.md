## Background and Problem
### It was reported that â€œthere are over 4000 x-ray machines in Nigeria with less than 5% of them under any form of regulatory control of the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA).There is, therefore, a need for proper Quality Assurance QA testing during installation and control tests at regular intervals as this will further help to reduce repeated radiograph and rejected films thereby saving cost and reducing patient doses.
